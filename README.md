# FuzeForecast
## Disclaimer
Although it wasn't a requirement, I chose to develop the challenge in Angular 9. This choice was motivated by the need for the script to run in NodeJS version 12.16 and supported in typescript 3.7. In addition, the choice for the usage of Angular is also justified for the way how the response models from the API are handled.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
